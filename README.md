I am Oliver, currently a hobbiest developer.

I just wanna become a real engineer, I am struggling with increasing my skills. I currently worked with typerscript, react, tried golang, python, java, and more.

I loved the process of learning new languages, now I come to realise I should focus on foundations of computer science, Ignore jumping over languages and frameworks

I created this repo, and I will be uploading the code of the tools that I build with my own head and hands.

As Junior a been stuck with using AI, and that made me feel as if am not in control or that work isn't original.

I be trying to remove all the noise balance everything.

I'll read opensource code, contribute, build things no matter how hard. Going in vim mode. 🥸

I am Oliver THE CREWMAN, rustacean, hobbiest programmer.

I work as a real engineer, have impact on society.

I am trying to enhance my skills. Different stacks, ts, py, go, and in rust deeply.

I love learning new things, focusing on foundations of computer science.

I hope this will be for me and my work and contributions.
